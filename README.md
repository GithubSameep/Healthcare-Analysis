# 🏥 Healthcare Analysis

## 📌 Project Title: **Healthcare Analysis Using Power BI**

---

## 🎯 Objective:

To build a comprehensive Power BI dashboard that helps stakeholders in the healthcare sector analyze patient data, billing details, hospital trends, and abnormal case distributions to make data-driven decisions.

---

## 🚨 Key Problems in the Healthcare Sector:

1. **Rising abnormal patient cases** without a clear view of the root causes
2. Lack of **centralized data visibility** across hospitals
3. Difficulty in tracking **billing performance** per insurance provider
4. No proper mechanism to analyze **seasonal admission trends**
5. Need to evaluate **age-wise and condition-wise health risks**

---

## 🧠 How This Dashboard Helps:

✅ Provides a high-level **snapshot of patients**, **billing amount**, and **abnormal cases**
✅ Breaks down patients by **medical condition**, **age group**, and **test results**
✅ Tracks **monthly trends** in patient admissions
✅ Gives comparative insights across **insurance providers**
✅ Uses **scatter plots** to relate billing amounts and abnormal test results by conditions

## 📊 Dashboard Components Breakdown:

### 1. **Top KPIs**

* **Total Patients (40K)** - Gives a quick look at the patient volume handled.
* **Total Billing Amount (₹1.42bn)** - Overall revenue generated through treatments.
* **Abnormal Patients (19K)** - Total cases with abnormal test results.
* **Count of Hospitals (55.5K)** - Shows data coverage and operational footprint.

### 2. **Donut Chart: Total Patients by Medical Condition**

* Conditions like Arthritis, Diabetes, Hypertension, Cancer, Obesity are equally distributed (\~8K each), indicating diversified health challenges.
* This insight is critical for resource allocation per department.

### 3. **Donut Chart: Admission Type by Age Group**

* Largest group: **Child (39.35%)**, followed by **Adult and Middle Age**.
* Helps identify which age groups require more healthcare attention.

### 4. **Line Chart: Abnormal Patients by Blood Type**

* Tracks blood type-wise abnormalities; higher in **B- and O+** blood types.
* Can guide research and targeted health screenings.

### 5. **Line Chart: Total Patients by Month**

* Identifies seasonality in patient visits, with spikes during **March and July**.
* Helps in staff planning, resource stockpiling, and preventive awareness campaigns.

### 6. **Stacked Bar Chart: Age Group vs Test Results**

* Each age group’s test result is classified into **Normal, Abnormal, and Inconclusive**.
* Useful for tracking age-related health vulnerabilities.

### 7. **Table: Insurance Provider-wise Metrics**

* Shows:

  * **Average Billing**
  * **Sum of Billing Amount**
  * **Abnormal Patient Count**
  * **Total Patients**
* Blue Cross and Cigna lead in total billing; Aetna has a lower abnormal rate.
* Critical for contract evaluation and performance tracking of providers.

### 8. **Scatter Chart: Billing vs Medical Condition/Test Results**

* Shows correlation between medical condition test results and average billing amount.
* Helps detect if certain conditions consistently have higher abnormality or billing.

### 9. **Gender Filter**

* Allows gender-wise breakdown of visuals — useful for comparing health trends among males and females.

### 10. **Admission Year Dropdown**

* Dynamic filter for year-wise analysis — enables temporal trend analysis.

## 🛠️ Tools & Techniques Used:

* Power BI Desktop
* DAX (for calculated measures like Abnormal Patient %, Billing Totals)
* Power Query for data cleaning
* Custom visuals: Donut Chart, Stacked Bar, Scatter Plot

---

## 🚀 Insights & Actions:

* **Children show the highest abnormality ratio** — suggests more pediatric screening programs.
* **March and July** require more medical staff due to high patient volume.
* **Blue Cross and Cigna** have high billing; further negotiation or review of service pricing can be done.
* **Blood type-based screening** can improve proactive diagnosis.

---

## 🧾 How This Helps Business Analysts:

* Enables **storytelling with data** to influence healthcare policies.
* Prepares you for real-time business problems using **interactive visuals**.
* Helps in tracking **KPIs and business health in real-time**.
